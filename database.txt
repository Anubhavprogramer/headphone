Database Design:
- Choose an RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
- Create a new database for your e-commerce website.

Schema Design:
a. Product Section:
- Create a table named `Products`.
- Sample `Products` table schema:
  - `product_id` (Primary Key)
  - `name`
  - `description`
  - `price`
  - `category`
  - `brand`
  - `image_url`
  - `stock_quantity`
  - `created_at`

b. Price Filter Section:
- Handle price range filtering on the frontend using JavaScript.

c. Gallery Section:
- Create a table named `ProductImages`.
- Sample `ProductImages` table schema:
  - `image_id` (Primary Key)
  - `product_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Products`)
  - `image_url`
  - `description`

d. Reviews Section:
- Create a table named `ProductReviews`.
- Sample `ProductReviews` table schema:
  - `review_id` (Primary Key)
  - `product_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Products`)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key if applicable)
  - `rating`
  - `review_text`
  - `created_at`

e. Contact Us Section:
- Store contact form submissions in a separate `Contacts` table.
- Sample `Contacts` table schema:
  - `contact_id` (Primary Key)
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `message`
  - `created_at`

Data Relationships:
- Define foreign key constraints to establish relationships between tables (e.g., `product_id` in `ProductImages` and `ProductReviews` references the `Products` table's primary key).

Database Normalization:
- Normalize the database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

Indexing:
- Create indexes on columns used for searching (e.g., `product_id`) to optimize query performance.

API and Backend Integration:
- Develop a backend API to interact with the database and serve data to your e-commerce website's frontend.

Remember to consider additional tables, user management, security measures, scalability, and performance optimization as needed. Implement data validation and sanitization for security.



Database Design Extension:
1. User Database:

   a. User Information:
   - Create a table named Users to store user information.
   - Sample Users table schema:
     - user_id (Primary Key)
     - username (User's username)
     - email (User's email address)
     - password (Hashed password)
     - created_at (Registration date)

   b. User Cart:
   - Create a table named UserCart to store the contents of a user's shopping cart.
   - Sample UserCart table schema:
     - cart_id (Primary Key)
     - user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)
     - product_id (Foreign Key referencing Products)
     - quantity (Number of items in the cart)

   c. User Orders:
   - Create a table named UserOrders to store information about the user's past orders.
   - Sample UserOrders table schema:
     - order_id (Primary Key)
     - user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)
     - order_date (Date and time of the order)
     - status (Order status, e.g., "shipped," "delivered")
     - total_amount (Total order amount)

2. Data Relationships:
   - Establish relationships between the new Users, UserCart, and UserOrders tables using foreign keys.

3. Database Normalization:
   - Normalize the user database tables to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.

4. Authentication and Security:
   - Implement user authentication and security measures to protect user data, including hashed password storage and secure user sessions.

Ensure that your backend API supports user authentication and provides the necessary endpoints to manage user-related operations like adding items to the cart, placing orders, and viewing order history.

Remember to implement data validation and sanitization for user input to enhance security, and consider scalability as your user base and order history grow.
